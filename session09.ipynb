    "## Recursion and trees (January 24, 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to turn everything on its head and introduce recursion into the game. **Recursion** occurs when we **define something in terms of itself or something else of its type**. For instance, we may define a file directory as a location on the computer that contains files *and (possibly) other directories*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is **useful for problems that can be represented as a series of subproblems of the same type**. To stay with the previous example, the problem of searching for a file, for instance, can be formulated recursively as follows (in pseudocode):\n",
    "\n",
    "        def search(directory):\n",
    "            if file in directory:\n",
    "                return(directory)\n",
    "            for subdirectory in directory:\n",
    "                    if search(subdirectory) != None:\n",
    "                        return search(subdirectory)\n",
    "            return None\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are **calling the function *search()*** within the body of the *search()* function, and are **doing so on a smaller problem space** (i.e., a subdirectory of our main directory). \n",
    "\n",
    "Successful recursion, that is, recursion that terminates at some point, requires that we define both a **base case** and a **recursive case**. In the example above, the base case is such that either (a) we find the *file* in the current directory or (b) there is no further subdirectory to search and the file does not exist. The recursive case is entered with a *for*-loop over all subdirectories, which calls on the search function again and returns the subdirectory in which the file is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thus, keep the following in mind when defining recursive functions:**\n",
    "- if the function calls itself on every input, we get infinite recursion\n",
    "- in all useful recursive functions, each nested call differs in its arguments (e.g. execution on subproblems)\n",
    "- for recursive functions to terminate, we need base cases!"
