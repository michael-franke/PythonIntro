    "\n",
    "**Experimental research in linguistics has grown in importance over the last few decades**. Two key research areas that depend on the experimental validation of hypotheses regarding, among others, language processing, production, and acquisition, are **psycho- and neurolinguistics**. Yet, even researchers that are primarily concerned with formal aspects of language (e.g. in syntax, semantics, or language typology) have turned to experimental research to address their research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistic experiments can be incredibly simple, for instance, when presenting participants with a sentence and asking for an **acceptability judgment**. Or they can be very complex, e.g., when simultaneously recording **eye-tracking** and **EEG** data while participants read sentence material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of experiment complexity, **we can use Python to implement such experiments and to statistically analyze the recorded data**. Today, we will look at a simple example of implementing a behavioral (button-press) experiment."

    "\n",
    "For today's purpose, we will be concerned with experiments conducted by Lassiter (2016) and Yastushiro et al. (2022) on epistemic modal adjectives and adverbs like *possible/possibly* and *certain/certainly*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Epistemic modal expressions provide an estimation of the likelihood that the state of affairs expressed in the clause applies to the world, according to either the speaker or some other epistemic authority (Nuyts, 2016). As such, epistemic modality can arguably be “subjective” or “objective” (Lyons, 1977), in that \"the former refers to the personal opinion of the speaker, whereas the latter refers to some factual chance that is of an interpersonal nature\" (Yatsushiro et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, it has been suggested that subjective and objective epistemic modality are (preferably) expressed by different linguistic forms. Specifically, epistemic modal adverbs like in (2) might be interpreted subjectively, whereas epistemic adjectives like (3) might be interpreted objectively (Hengeveld 1988; Nuyts 1992; 1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "        (2) Abdul certainly / probably / possibly is at school.\n",
    "\n",
    "        (3) It is certain / probable / possible that Abdul is at school.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is further supported by distributional differences regarding their appearance under negation and in questions (for details, see Yatsushiro et al., 2022):\n",
    "\n",
    "    (4) a.  Abdul is *uncertainly at school.\n",
    "        b. It is not certain that Abdul is at school.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (5) a. Is Abdul *certainly at school?\n",
    "        b. Is it certain that Abdul is at school?\n",
    "    \n",
    "**The research question**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Do these two types of epistemic operators [really] have different interpretations? That is, given a certain situation that leads to a certain estimation of likelihood for a proposition, would speakers apply an epistemic adjective differently from its corresponding epistemic adverb?\" (Yatsushiro et al., 2022) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Method** (Lassiter, 2016; Yatsushiro et al., 2022 Experiment 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants read a context scenario that provides a measureable likelihood for a certain event (6). In a subsequent critical sentence (6a-d), they are confronted with an epistemic modal adjective or adverb. They must provide a judgment of **whether they agree with the assertion**. The hypothesis is that participants \"would be less strict in their use of subjective *possibly* and *certainly*, on the ground that a privately held certainty, or denial of possibility, may be felt to be less subject to public scrutiny and approbation if it turns out to be incorrect.\" (Lassiter, 2016: 132)\n",

    "*Pygame* is a Python package primarily designed for writing video games. Experiments, in many respects, are just like video games, thus the module has become popular for the implementation of (behavioural) experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in video games, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **control frame-by-frame visual displays**, including the appearance of images, text, and other elements.\n",
    "- in some cases, this includes **synchronized audiovisual signals**\n",
    "- **record and save** reaction times, button presses and other user-provided input\n",
    "- **conditionally execute parts of the code** based on button presses or other user input\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pygame offers a range of methods to do this.** With respect to **visual displays**, the *display* module offers a range of methods that allow you to control the contents displayed on screen. Pygame has a single display Surface that is either contained in a window or runs full screen. You must first initialize this surface, e.g., as fullscreen display or window of specified dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 480), pg.SCALED)\n",
    "   \n",
    "Then you can modify the contents of that surface, e.g., by changing its color or adding text / images at varying positions. Changes are not immediately visible on the real screen; you must use the \"flipping\" function *flip()* to update the actual display.\n",

    "    screen.fill(bgColor)\n",
    "    pygame.display.flip() \n",
    "    \n",
    "With respect to **recording (and reacting to) user input**, Pygame continually records all user input as \"events\" in an event queue. Events can have different types, such as key presses, mouse clicks, or movements of a joystick. The *get()* method gets all events from the current queue and removes them from it. By calling this method repeatedly, on every single frame, until a specified event occurs, we can control the execution of the experiment. \n",
