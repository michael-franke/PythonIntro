    "\n",
    "**So far, all of our Python programs were self-contained**, that is, they did not rely on external data files or pieces of code (except for in-built Python functions and methods). In most real-life situations, however, you will work off of existing files (e.g., for data analysis) or from pre-existing code (e.g., when adding new functionalities to an app or program). In this session, you will learn how to **import and use** external Python code as **modules** and how to **create, read from, and write to files**.\n",

    "### Modules\n",

As such, modules allow us **(a) to distribute code across multiple files** (which is convenient for bigger coding projects) and **(b) to make use of collections of useful functions** provided by other programmers. Many modules come with Python as part of the default installation. One such example is the *Itertools* module we saw in the previous session. Others include the *math* module and the *random* module, which contain helpful functions for mathematical operations and for dealing with distributional data.\n",

    "As mentioned above, you can read and write files in various encodings. Technically, an encoding specifies the **mapping between characters and the bit sequences that they are encoded as**. Every text files encodes characters according to some encoding, the most relevant ones (for now) being **ASCII** (7-bit, English alphabet only), **ISO 8859** (8-bit, variable encodings depending on region/language, alphabetical writing systems only), and **UTF-8** unicode (variable length of 1-4 bytes (fyi, 1 byte = 1 8-bit sequence), all writing systems). The default encoding in Python is **UTF-8**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",

    "There's **no difference in the encoding** of characters compatible with the **English alphabet**:  \n",

    "- ISO 8859-1 binary encoding of \"A\" = 01000001  \n",
    "\n",
    "But it **matters for many other languages** (most obviously all languages with writing systems that do not use the Latin alphabet). Even for languages using the Latin alphabet, subtle differences mean that some encodings cannot capture their full character set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following German sentence can only be encoded in UTF-8: \n",

    "- multi-byte encoding with enough room for all current and many future symbols (1 114 111, of which 136 690 are currently used)\n",
    "- unicode can be encoded as **UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32**, where each character will be represented as a sequence of one to four 8-bit bytes, one or two 16-bit code units, or a single 32-bit code unit, respectively.\n",
