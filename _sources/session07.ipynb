    "Efficiency is key. Therefore, in this session, you will learn more about advanced aspects of efficient programming. We have already discussed how to improve code efficiency and maintainability in small programs. Sooner or later, however, additional questions may emerge: How should you **distribute code over a main program and importable modules**? Where can time and effort be saved by **relying on already available modules and packages**? Can **repeating patterns** in the task at hand be detected and exploited for further automization? \n"

    "All regular languages are describable by regular expressions. Let's assume a language with alphabet Σ = {a, b, c}. Regular expressions over this alphabet can use any of its constants (characters) as well as the three basic operations admittable by the definition of regular languages:\n",

    "- **Concatenation**: in linear order, combine two elements of the alphabet: *ab, aab, aaabb, aacbbb, ...* \n",
    "- **Alternation**: free choice of either the (potentially multi-character) expressions on the left or right of the pipe symbol: *a|b, (ab)|(bc), (accc)|b,...*\n",
